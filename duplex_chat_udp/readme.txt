The difference between duplex and half-duplex chat is that in half-duplex the client and server have to wait for each others turns to send message,like a walky-talky.It happens because the socket's ability to read while writing will be blocked in half-duplex.So we are using the system call **"select"** to non-block the socket.It just checks whether the socket has data to read or write and performs the necessary action!
